 Web Application Vulnerability Assessment

This repository contains my cybersecurity internship project, where I performed a vulnerability assessment of intentionally vulnerable web applications. The goal was to identify security flaws, map them against the OWASP Top 10, and provide a professional security assessment report with actionable recommendations.

This project simulates real-world client work for startups, SaaS companies, or e-commerce platforms that need to secure their websites against cyber threats.

 Objectives

Identify security vulnerabilities in test web applications (DVWA).

Use ethical hacking tools to scan, exploit, and analyze vulnerabilities.

Map findings to the OWASP Top 10 framework.

Compile results in a professional security report with remediation steps.

Tools & Environment

OWASP Juice Shop – Modern vulnerable web app.

DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) – Lightweight testbed.

Burp Suite (Community Edition) – Web app penetration testing toolkit.

Kali Linux – scanning environment.


✅ Scope of Work

Setup & Exploration – Deployed DVWA in a local/lab environment.

Scanning & Testing – Used Burp Suite and manual testing to find:

SQL Injection

Brute force

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Broken Authentication

Other OWASP Top 10 risks

Threat Analysis – Assessed impact and likelihood of each vulnerability.

Documentation – Created a detailed Security Assessment Report with:

Vulnerability description & screenshots

Impact rating (Low/Medium/High)

Remediation steps

OWASP Top 10 mapping

📄 Deliverables

📝 Security Assessment Report (PDF) – Includes vulnerabilities, risk ratings, screenshots, and fixes.

📊 OWASP Top 10 Compliance Checklist – Mapping of tested vulnerabilities.


📌 How to Use This Repo

Review the report.pdf for detailed findings.

Explore the checklist.md for OWASP Top 10 mapping.

Check logs/ folder for raw scan results.

Follow remediation steps to harden vulnerable apps.

 Next Steps

This project is a foundation for penetration testing and bug bounty hunting. Future enhancements include:

Expanding testing to real-world SaaS platforms (with permission).

Automating reports with Python scripts.

Integrating findings into a CI/CD security pipeline.
